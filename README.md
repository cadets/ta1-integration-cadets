# CADETS example trace data 
Available at https://github.com/cadets/trace-data
The trace data is in a CADETS specific JSON format, not TC CDM.

# CDM Translator
This will be a python translator program that takes a CADETS trace as input and outputs records in the CDM format, and publishes them to a TA3 kafka broker
Details of the CADETS-to-CDM translation will be stored here
